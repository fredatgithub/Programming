<p>We decided that we would buy a dog this summer. We bought a chocolate labrador retriever that we named Khunde, after a village in Nepal that we loved. Here are two pictures of Khunde when he was a small and then when he got bigger.</p>

<p>You can see teh Khnude was a puppy then. We put him next to the other puppy since we had two at the time. He was the bigger one with brown eyes in the litter, and was extremely friendly to people. We liked that he came right up to us when we first went into his puppy pen to see all of the other puppies.</p>

<p>He weighed 13 pounds when we brought him home. He did real well fromteh first time that he stepped into the house. We bough a dog bed for him to sleep in, but he liked sleeping at the end of our bed on an old blanket. It was fun buying the dog toys for him to play with.</p>

<h2>Summer 2004</h2>

<p>This is just one year later and look how big he has gotten. Khnude now weighs 75 punds and stands three feet tall at the shoulder. We hired a trainer who came to the house to train him. Khnude did really well with that and knows all of his commands, such as sit, stay, and lay down.</p>

<p>We also had an invisable fince installed around the front yard. This is so helpful, especially since we live on a relitively busy street. It makes us feel more comfortable that he is safe, and the small children who live nearby do not have to worry about a large dog approaching them.</p>
