<h2><center>About the pictures</center></h2>
<p><center>These are pictures that I took of my girlfriend <i>Erin FitzGerald</i> riding her horse <i>Brady</i>. Horses are very interesting animals, they are smart, comforting, and act just like dogs sometimes. Erin has rode on horses since she was just a little kid, riding several horses has given her an idea on how to ride different types of horses and a better understanding of them. </center></p>
