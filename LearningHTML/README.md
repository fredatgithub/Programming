# Web-Design
This repository is for keeping all my Web Design files backed up and so I can also check them at home. This is a class from Conway High School where I learn H.T.M.L. so that I can just make small little fun websites. Every day I move the files from my school computer onto Google Drive then to Git on my home PC due to the restrictions of our school.
