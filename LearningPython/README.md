# Python
I am using [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) to learn Python Programming. This book has the choice of purchasing it or even learning to use it online for free. Both ways are great, but it is always nice to give back to those who help us out of course. Please visit [LearnCodeTheHardWay](http://learncodethehardway.org/) if you are interested in supporting them or interested in learning some of the other select languages they have available.
